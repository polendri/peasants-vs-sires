## How to Play

You can play the game at [pshendry.github.io/peasants-vs-sires](http://pshendry.github.io/peasants-vs-sires).

### Goal

The aim of the game is to eliminate all of the opposing soldiers on the battlefield. Each player
has a timeline demonstrating how long until reinforcements arrive; when a reinforcement arrives,
you must decide whether to send them for help (queuing up TWO reinforcements), or to send them
to the battlefield to fight.

Reinforcements don't count towards preventing you from being eliminated, so make sure to keep
some soldiers on the battlefield! As an added complication, some soldiers are better fighters
than others, making them poor candidates for sending away for reinforcements.

### Controls

Player 1 (leader of the peasants): 'Q' to send for reinforcements, and 'W' to send to fight.

Player 2 (leader of the sires): 'O' to send for reinforcements, and 'P' to send to fight.

ESC will pause the game.
